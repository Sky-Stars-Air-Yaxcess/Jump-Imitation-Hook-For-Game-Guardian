This method was created for educational purposes only. Users are solely responsible for how they use it. We respect developers and urge them to fix vulnerabilities. Our goal is not to cause harm, but to promote fair and secure gameplay!

Warnings: This is a real and legitimate inline imitation hook for Game Guardian (I was the first to create it here; this tool was not originally supposed to have any hooks!).

It only works on Unity il2cpp 64-bit builds where you can dump the game!
