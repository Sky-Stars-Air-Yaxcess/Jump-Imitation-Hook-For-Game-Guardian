Warnings: This is a real and legitimate inline imitation hook for Game Guardian (I was the first to create it here; this tool was not originally supposed to have any hooks!).


Example dump.cs and How to make instructions Imitation hook for Game Guardian. 

public class PlayerCallBackCheck RVA 0x1ACB08C Name Method 0x1ACB08C Jump Imitation Hook goto Address RVA Find AARCH64 ASSLEMBER ~A8 STR	 X20, [SP,#-0x20]! Jump Imitation Hook AARCH64 ASSLEMBER HOOK CODE ~A8 B [PC,#-0x] need RVA OnAttack DestroyAll

public static class PhotonNetwork RVA 0x1292F44 Name Method public static void DestroyAll() { } Jump Imitation Hook goto Address RVA Find AARCH64 ASSLEMBER ~A8 STR	 X20, [SP,#-0x20]! Jump Imitation Hook AARCH64 ASSLEMBER CODE A8 B [PC,#-0x] need save

it's same DestroyAll

FIND AARCH64 ASSLEMBER ~A8 TBZ	 X0, #0x0, [PC,#0x38] EDIT ~A8 TBZ	 X0, #0x0, [PC,#0x4] need blocked bit banned DestroyAll

We now need to insert ~A8 B [PC,#-0x838148] into the OnAttack method 
This offset there is OnAttack+DestroyAll they are connected and combined in 1 offset.
